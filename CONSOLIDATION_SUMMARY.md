# Features Directory Consolidation

This document summarizes the consolidation of the `features/` directory into the main `project2/` application structure.

## Files Moved and Consolidated

### Algorithms (moved to `project2/utils/`)
- `features/friend_recommendation/algorithms/recommendationAlgorithm.js` → `project2/utils/recommendationAlgorithm.js`
- `features/friend_recommendation/algorithms/recommendationGenerator.js` → `project2/utils/recommendationGenerator.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/algorithms/skillMatcher.js` → `project2/utils/skillMatcher.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/algorithms/interestSimilarityCalculator.js` → `project2/utils/interestSimilarityCalculator.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/algorithms/feedbackAggregator.js` → `project2/utils/feedbackAggregator.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/algorithms/matchScoreCalculator.js` → `project2/utils/matchScoreCalculator.js`

### Services (moved to `project2/services/`)
- `features/friend_recommendation/services/recommendationService.js` → `project2/services/recommendationService.js`
- `features/friend_recommendation/services/friendshipService.js` → `project2/services/friendshipService.js`
- Created new consolidated service: `project2/services/projectCollaborationService.js`

### Data Models (moved to `project2/models/`)
- `features/friend_recommendation/data/friendshipSchema.js` → `project2/models/friendshipSchema.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/data/skillSchema.js` → `project2/models/skillSchema.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/data/interestSchema.js` → `project2/models/interestSchema.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/data/feedbackSchema.js` → `project2/models/feedbackSchema.js`
- `features/project_collaboration/data/projectSchema.js` → `project2/models/projectCollaborationSchema.js`

### New Utilities Created
- `project2/utils/cacheUtils.js` - Simple in-memory caching implementation

## Import Path Updates

All import statements have been updated to reflect the new file locations:
- `../../features/friend_recommendation/algorithms/` → `../utils/`
- `../data/` → `../models/`
- Cache utilities now use local implementation

## Files Safe to Delete

After this consolidation, the entire `features/` directory can be safely deleted along with:
- All test files (`.test.js`, `.int.test.js`)
- `compass-connections.json` (unused configuration file)

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simplified Structure**: Single directory structure instead of modular features
2. **Easier Maintenance**: All code in one place
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No cross-directory dependencies
4. **Better Performance**: Shorter import paths
5. **Clearer Architecture**: Main application with utilities and services

## Next Steps

1. Test the application to ensure all functionality works
2. Delete the `features/` directory
3. Update any documentation references
4. Consider adding unit tests for the consolidated utilities
